            <p>In this place was a stream with very clean water. The stream was locally known as “Buñao” and made the place famous for its good water either for drinking, bathing, washing and other uses. People begun to concentrate in the present barrio site until the barrio was organized, and the name ” Buñao ” was adopted. The word itself does not express literally any Visayan word but in as much as it was originally the name of a river or stream, it must have been derived from the Spanish word ” Buñao ” or adulteration. During the course of many generations from the establishment of the barrio, the name ” Buñao ” continued to live up to the present time.</p>
